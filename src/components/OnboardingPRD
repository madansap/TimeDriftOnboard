# Onboarding PRD

## Timedrift isn’t a productivity tool. It’s an ambient, aesthetic layer for your day. It shows your timezones, your timeline, and your calendar—no clicks, no clutter. Keep it on a second monitor, use it as a screensaver, or replace your new tab. It’s for people who care about how their workspace *feels.*

**Zero-friction onboarding** but with *just enough* context to not confuse new users.

**Flow:**

- Fade-in intro overlay → quick 3 hints → done
- Total time: **5 seconds**
